# Maze Solver

This widget creates a 10 by 10 grid using Tkinter and requests the user to create a start node, an end node, and walls, and will find a route from the start to the end around the walls. Two version on the repository differ in the solving algorithm that they employ; BFS and DFS based on the node with the shortest straight line distance to the end.
